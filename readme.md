# AUR-React

**React-series projects / experiments by Abinash**

## Description  
AUR-React is a collection of small React (and Vite + JS/TS/HTML/CSS where appropriate) projects exploring the fundamentals of React and related frontend web development.  
The repo contains several standalone demo apps (counter, password generator, currency converter, etc.) — great for learning, experimenting, and building React intuition.

## Projects Included  
| Folder / Demo | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `01basicreact` | Basic React setup / learning project |
| `01vitereact` | React + Vite setup |

| `06currencyConvertor` | Currency converter demo app |
| `customReact` | Experimental / custom React-like builds or utilities (if any) |
| *(you can add more rows as you expand)* | |

## Technologies Used  
- JavaScript / HTML / CSS  
- React for UI and component-based structure  
- Optionally Vite (in `01vitereact`) for fast bundling & dev server  
- Basic CSS / utility CSS (or Tailwind if used) for styling  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.  

### Installation & Run  
```bash
# Clone the repository  
git clone https://github.com/Abinash6000/aur-react.git  
cd aur-react  

# For a specific demo (for example `02counter`)  
cd 02counter  
npm install  
npm start  

# The app should now be running — open http://localhost:3000 (or whatever port) in your browser
```  

Repeat for other demos by navigating into their folders and running the same commands.

## Usage Examples / Features  
- Counter app: increment/decrement, demonstrate React state & hooks  
- Password generator: generate random passwords with configurable options  
- Currency converter: simple form + calculation UI  
- Basic React starter (with manual setup / Vite + React) — good reference for new projects  

*(You may insert screenshots or GIFs here to show the UI in action for better clarity.)*
